# My Digit Recognizer ✏️

A Streamlit application that lets you draw digits directly in your browser and predicts the digit using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on MNIST. This README provides an overview of the project’s features, setup instructions, and usage details.

## ✨ Features

1. **Interactive Drawing Canvas**  
   - Draw digits in real-time using Streamlit’s drawable canvas.  
   - No need to upload separate images.

2. **Instant Predictions**  
   - The CNN model predicts the digit (0–9) immediately after you click **Predict**.  
   - Displays a probability distribution for each possible digit.

3. **MNIST CNN Model**  
   - Uses a TensorFlow/Keras CNN trained on the MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images).  
   - Includes layers such as Convolution, Pooling, Dropout, and Dense for robust performance.

4. **Easy Integration**  
   - Written in Python with a straightforward setup process.  
   - Easily extend or modify the model for other digit-related tasks.
